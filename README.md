### _Stylesheets For Storyboards_
Stylish is a library that lets you create stylesheets in code or in JSON to controll nearly any available property in UIView, UILabel, UIButton, UIImage, UITextfield as well as applying multiple styles and overriding properties.

Whole project is based on https://github.com/daniel-hall/Stylish but it's changing the philosophy of setting properties, wrapping around elements rather then hardcoiding them. This allows as to access any property that is available in runtime as well as few additinal like UIFonts.

## Installation
